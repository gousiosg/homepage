A popular form of software reuse is the use of Open-Source Software (OSS) libraries, hosted on centralized code repositories, such as Maven or NPM.
Developers only need to declare dependencies to external libraries, and automated tools make them available to the workspace of the project.

In the
recent years, we have seen package management fail in spectacular ways:

* In the [lefpad incident](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/), a developer broke a significant part of the Internet
just by removing a package from NPM.
* Equifax [lost $4 billion](http://time.com/money/4936732/equifaxs-massive-data-breach-has-cost-the-company-4-billion-so-far/) because they deemed a security
update unnecessary.
* A Linux kernel developer [engaged in a series of litigation actions](https://lwn.net/Articles/731941/) against tens of companies claiming lost revenue, due to, in his view, in-proper enforcement of GPL in a transitively derivative project.
* A [recent study](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3205288) by Lauinger et al. found that 1 out of 3 top sites uses at least one library with a known vulnerability.

The list goes on. Package management, and its repercussions, is a topic that
affects the daily lives of millions of developers, but it has only received
moderate attention from researchers.

Last spring, I led a group of 7 partners towards the submission of a project
proposal to the H2020-ICT-18 call. Then, in August, we were in for a very
pleasant surprise: the EC granted our consortium a significant amount of money
to make package management more intelligent!

The core idea behind FASTEN is really simple: _instead of analyzing dependencies
at the package level, we will analyze them at the call graph level_! This will
allow us to be super precise when we are tracking dependencies, when
we do change impact analysis, when we recommend clients to update packages etc.
It will also open the door to new sophisticated applications, e.g. licensing compliance, dependency risk profiling and data-driven API evolution.

As it is usual in those cases, while the idea sounds simple and straightforward,
its practical implementation, [as we learned in our related work on
Rust](https://pure.tudelft.nl/portal/en/publications/prazi-from-packagebased-to-precise-callbased-dependency-network-analyses(6e9d35bd-b512-4bdd-80c1-53608d2acda6.html),
is anything but.  Static call graph generators are imprecise; modern features in
programming languages (dynamic dispatch, extensible classes) complicate static
call graph generation; in many languages, projects need to be built before
constructing call-graphs; the generated graphs are huge and moreover the queries
we will need to run will bring current graph databases to their knees; and more.
However, the accuracy benefits of creating ecosystem-level, versioned
call-graphs outweight the drawbacks. In our preliminary Rust study, we found
that in the case of pin-pointing vulnerable packages, accuracy can be improved
by **3x**, the issues mentioned above withstanding.

Our vision for better dependency management goes beyond giant call graphs.
Our goal, and also the project's _raison d'Ãªtre_, is to bring the benefits
of fine-grained dependency tracking to the hands of developers. To do this,
we will create a continuously updated service that automatically analyzes
all package versions in the Java, Python and C (Debian) ecosystems and
maintains the call-graphs centrally. On top of this, we will create processes
that read data from external sources (e.g. security disclosures, GitHub
analytics) and enrich the graph, by appending information to the graph nodes
(functions). To compensate for inefficiencies in call-graph generation,
we will allow clients to upload call-graphs generated by running a project's
test suite; this will allow us to enrich the graph edges (function calls).
We will implement custom analyses (e.g. vulnerability tracking)
as efficient traversals on our graph.
And, importantly, we will create plug-ins for Maven and
PyPI, to enable developers and CI environments to query the FASTEN knowledge
base in a way that looks like this:

```
$ pip list
docutils (0.10)
Jinja2 (2.7.2)
MarkupSafe (0.18)

$ pip check-security
Jinja2 (2.7.2) has known vulnerabilities (your project is affected!)
Update to version >=2.7.3 (will not break your project)

$ pip test-upgrade Jinja2 --version 2.8
Upgrading to Jinja2 2.8 will break the following methods:
  myproject.foo()
  myproject.bar()

$ pip what-breaks --delete myproject.foo
The following direct dependencies will break if you *delete* function foo()
* projectA: 15 methods use foo()
* projectB: 10 methods use foo()
632 indirect dependencies will fail to work.

$ pip test --upload-dyngraph
............15 Tests run OK!
Dynamic call graph at: myproject.dot
Uploading dynamic call graph to FASTEN
```
