### MSc theses --- Internships

At Endor Labs, we are always open for smart and hardworking students that would like to spend
sometime with us. If you are interested to do an MSc thesis or an internship,
take a look at my [research interests](research.html),
and if those match yours, [contact me](about.html).

### Courses

In the past, I was actively involved in designing and teaching educational material.
I like teaching a lot: If you would like me to give a lecture at your course,
don't hesitate to ask: I will most hapilly oblidge!

### Tutorials

I occasionally give tutorials, mostly to fellow researchers. Here are the
latest ones:

* {% cite_details SG18 --text MSR with Git and Unix %}@ICSE 2018, with [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www.spinellis.gr/index.html.var). We explained how to use Git and Unix to effectively mine thousands of repos.
* {% cite_details G18 --text MSR with Spark %}@ICSE 2018. I explained how to use Apache Spark from common tasks when mining software repositories.
* {% cite_details GS17 --text Mining GHTorrent %}@ICSE 2017, with [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www.spinellis.gr/index.html.var). We explained how to effectively use
GHTorrent to mine data from GitHub.
